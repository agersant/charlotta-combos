# Common oki situations

## After parry

Triggering the <combo>5U</combo> cinematic gives an auto-timed safe jump.

## After throw

After forward-throw, <combo>M Flip dive</combo> works like a safe jump.

In the corner, you can simply hold <img class="icon" d9> to get a safe jump.

## After back throw

Auto-timed safe jump simply holding <img class="icon" d9> during the throw animation.

## After SBA

SBA has a number of oki options that work anywhere:

|--|--|
|<combo>L Ball, cH</combo>|<video src="/assets/videos/oki-SBA-ball-cH.mp4" controls="controls"></video>|
|<combo>D, cH</combo>|<video src="/assets/videos/oki-SBA-run-up-cH.mp4" controls="controls"></video>|
|<combo>H Flip low</combo>|<video src="/assets/videos/oki-SBA-flip-low.mp4" controls="controls"></video>*<center>⚠️ Very easy to DP on reaction!</center>*|

## After SBA in the corner

Super jump becomes a safe jump. You can hold <img class="icon" d6> throughout the cinematic and tap <img class="icon" d2><img class="icon" d8> after Charlotta lands.

Regular jump followed by <combo>L Flip</combo> is a good throw bait.

## After <img class="icon" unique> DP

When hitting a **grounded** opponent with <combo>U DP</combo>, you have access to safe jump.

<p><combo>L Flip dive</combo> also works.</p>

## After <img class="icon" heavy> Flip grab

Flip grab on grounded opponents only gives access to combos in the corner. Here are midscreen oki setups.

<p><combo>8, fH</combo> will hit the opponent on wakeup.</p>

<video src="/assets/videos/oki-flip-grab-fH.mp4" controls="controls"></video>

Whiffing <combo>M DP</combo> leaves you +1 and in range to hit <combo>fM</combo>.

{% include bubble.html content="This looks similar to a dropped combo." %}

## After <img class="icon" heavy> Ball

You can manually time a <combo>66H</combo>, only if the opponent does not backroll.

## After <img class="icon" medium> Ball

<p><combo>M Ball</combo> works as its own oki, which is very funny but punishable (-10 on block).</p>
