## Introduction

Hi, I'm agersant (aka NobleBadger) and this website documents the gameplan I use when playing Charlotta.

The information here is not meant to be exhaustive. The combos and setups listed have a strong bias towards ease of execution and reliability. I try to avoid combos that require evaluating juggle height, making decisions early in the combo, or difficult inputs.

In the grand scheme of things, I'm also not that good at the game so take all this with a grain of salt. I just like having notes, and making little websites is fun.

I hope this page can help other Charlotta players. It assumes you already know how the game works in general.

## Combo notation

Normals are prefixed with **c** or **f** to distinguish close and far versions.

Cancels are represented by a chevron: <combo>fL > L Ball</combo>

Links are represented by a comma: <combo>H Lumiel, fM</combo>

Special moves use these informal names:
