# Block pressure

## With autocombo

<p><combo>L Ball</combo> ends your turn safely:</p>

The <combo>6H</combo> overhead ender can surprise people, and gives you another turn on hit:

Cancelling into <combo>M Lumiel</combo> frametraps and is +1 on block. On crouching hit, confirm into <combo>fL</combo>:

Cancelling into <combo>H Lumiel</combo> leaves no gap and is +4 on block. On block, enforce your advantage with <combo>fM/2U</combo>, or try to reset pressure with <combo>66L</combo>:

When starting an autocombo specifically with c<img class="icon" medium>, the advance leaves you close enough to make <combo>cMMT</combo> a threat. This loses to mashing or simply walking back.

## With c<img class="icon" light>

Having the opponent block c<img class="icon" light> gives many good options that aren't very Charlotta specific:

|--|--|
|<combo>cL, cL</combo>|<video src="/assets/videos/pressure-cL-cL.mp4" controls="controls"></video>_<center>Can also microwalk in-between</center>_|
|<combo>cL, cH</combo>|<video src="/assets/videos/pressure-cL-cH.mp4" controls="controls"></video>|
|<combo>cL, 2L, fL</combo>|<video src="/assets/videos/pressure-cL-mixed.mp4" controls="controls"></video>|
|<combo>cL, 6, throw</combo>|<video src="/assets/videos/pressure-cL-throw.mp4" controls="controls"></video>|

## With <img class="icon" d2><img class="icon" light>

<p><combo>2L</combo> can be cancelled into itself or into f<img class="icon" light>:</p>

<video src="/assets/videos/pressure-2L-fL.mp4" controls="controls"></video>

{% include bubble.html content="If you cancel too fast this won't frametrap." %}

<p><combo>2L, T</combo> often catches people offguard and requires no manual timing:</p>

## With f<img class="icon" light>

<p><combo>fL</combo> is +1 on block and often in range to connect <combo>fM/2U</combo>:</p>

<video src="/assets/videos/pressure-fL-fM.mp4" controls="controls"></video>

Against dedicated mashers, you can infinitely loop <combo>fL > L Ball</combo>:

## Using flip

Flip is a good pressure reset but always reactable. Avoid using it after the opponent blocks all three hits of autocombo, that is when they will be most ready for it.

During stagger pressure:

After a single normal:

Ambiguous sideswap after jump in:
